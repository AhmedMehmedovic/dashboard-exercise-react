I made this application while learning react framework following the Javascript mastery course. In creating this dashboard app, I used syncfusion ### `https://www.syncfusion.com/`, which makes coding a lot easier. Also during this training I learned how to use tailwind 'https://tailwindcss.com/' classes to style elements. I also had to match syncfusion and react versions to make everything work. I had to create a trial acc to use syncfusion. Some changes are custom, so the app is not completely identical like app in course.

The application is a simple example of a panel that contains calendar pages with the possibility of adding tasks, monitoring certain parameters, for graphics, etc. It is also possible to change the theme color and theme mode.
The project is interesting and you can learn a lot while making it.
